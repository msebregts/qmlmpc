# qmlmpc

qmlmpc is a Music Player Daemon (MPD) client with a touch-based User Interface written in Qt QML.

## Build instructions

qmlmpc needs at least Qt 5.1* to run. Open the project in Qt Creator and hit the build&run button.

*not tested, but Qt 5.4 works fine.

## Origins

qmlmpc used to be a part of another program, intended for in-house use only.
It is tailored for an android tablet with screen resolution 1280x800 pixels. This is why all interface elements have a hardcoded size.

The MPD client part of this other program is no longer in use, therefore this release of qmlmpc was prepared in the hope it is useful to anyone.

Consult the Qt documentation on how to build this program for Android tablets.
